 Objectives

1. Send an email notification after a user signs up.
2. Connect the database to the UI and show all signed-up users.
3. Validate email addresses and handle errors (no crashes).

 Step 1: Database Setup (MariaDB)

 Created a database called `dol`.
 Added a `users` table with these fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

The **email** column is marked `UNIQUE` so that duplicate emails are not allowed.

---

 Step 2: Configuration File

* Made a `conf.php` file with the database credentials:

php
$conf['db_host'] = "localhost";
$conf['db_user'] = "root";
$conf['db_pass'] = "munyoiks7";
$conf['db_name'] = "dol";
```

* Connected to MariaDB using **MySQLi**.
* Added error handling in case the connection fails.

---

 Step 3: Signup Form

Created an HTML form to collect:

  * Name
  * Email
  * Password

Used PHP to handle the form submission.

Validation & Duplication Check:

* First, check if the email format is valid.
* Then, check if the email already exists in the database.
* If duplicate → show error.
* If not duplicate → insert the new user.

---

 Step 4: Sending Email Notification

After successful signup, send a **welcome/verification email** using `mail()` (or PHPMailer).

Example email body:

```
Hello [User],
You requested an account on [Site].
Click the verification link to complete registration.
Regards,
System Admin
```

 Step 5: Display Users

* Fetched all registered users from the database.
* Displayed them in ascending order (by ID).
* Each user is shown with a number, name, and email.
